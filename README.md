CF-Console
==========

CF-Console is an easy-to-use web-based interface for your [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/) instances.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/frodenas/cf-console.png)](http://travis-ci.org/frodenas/cf-console)

Demo
----
Check [CF-Console at cloudfoundry.com](http://cf-console.cloudfoundry.com/).

Deploy to CloudFoundry
----------------------

```
git clone git://github.com/frodenas/cf-console.git
cd cf-console
bundle
bundle exec rake assets:precompile
vmc push --runtime ruby19
# press Enter for all defaults
```

Installation
------------
No DB required, just clone the project and start the server:

* git clone git://github.com/frodenas/cf-console.git
* bundle install
* thin start <- It must be an app server with EventMachine and Ruby 1.9 support
(e.g. [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) or [Rainbows!](http://rainbows.rubyforge.org/))

If you plan to deploy this app to a production environment:

* Set your brand details and Cloud Foundry providers at /config/configatron/defaults.rb
* Insert your Google Analytics Web Property ID (UA-XXXXX-X) at /app/assets/javascripts/application.js
* Change the secret token at /config/initializers/secret_token.rb
* Remove "= render "layouts/forkapp"" at /app/views/layouts/application.html.haml
* precompile the assets -> RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile
* enable "config.middleware" option at /config/application.rb to enable async http calls

Testing
-------

In order to test the application, a suite of [RSpec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec) tests are provided.
You don't need to have a Cloud Foundry instance running in order to pass the tests, as pre-recorded HTTP
interactions are also provided thanks to [VCR](https://www.relishapp.com/myronmarston/vcr).

So just type:

    rake spec
